### Indicators

In exchange practice, there is such a concept as indicators, they are used by traders to understand when they should open a position, and when it should be closed. An entire class has been created for this purpose in the Event. Let's take a look at its structure and examine it in more detail.

```javascript
class indicators {
    delta () {
        return {
            "bybit": {
                "deribit": {
                    "delta": 0,
                    "precent": {
                        A: 0 
                    },
                }, 
                "...": {
                    "...": "..."
                }           
            }
        }   
    }
}
```
